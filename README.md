ShopAssist AI
Project Overview
ShopAssist AI is an intelligent chatbot designed to enhance the online shopping experience by offering personalized laptop recommendations. Built using a combination of large language models (LLMs) and rule-based functions, this chatbot delivers accurate and reliable information, helping users make informed purchasing decisions.

Why ShopAssist AI?
In the modern digital landscape, online shopping provides convenience but can also overwhelm consumers with countless options. Users often struggle to find the best product that suits their needs, particularly when they are unfamiliar with specific product details. ShopAssist AI addresses this problem by acting as a virtual assistant that simplifies the laptop selection process.

Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to develop a chatbot that processes a dataset containing various details about laptops, such as product names, specifications, and descriptions. Using this dataset, the chatbot provides accurate and contextually relevant recommendations based on the userâ€™s preferences and requirements.
