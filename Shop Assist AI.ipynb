ShopAssist AI
Project Background
In today's digital age, online shopping has become the go-to option for many consumers. However, the overwhelming number of choices and the lack of personalized assistance can make the shopping experience daunting. To address this, we have developed ShopAssist AI, a chatbot that combines the power of large language models and rule-based functions to ensure accurate and reliable information delivery.

Problem Statement
Given a dataset containing information about laptops (product names, specifications, descriptions, etc.), build a chatbot that parses the dataset and provides accurate laptop recommendations based on user requirements.

import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('laptop_data2.csv')

Approach:
Conversation and Information Gathering: The chatbot will utilize language models to understand and generate natural responses. Through a conversational flow, it will ask relevant questions to gather information about the user's requirements.
Information Extraction: Once the essential information is collected, rule-based functions come into play, extracting top 3 laptops that best matches the user's needs.
Personalized Recommendation: Leveraging this extracted information, the chatbot engages in further dialogue with the user, efficiently addressing their queries and aiding them in finding the perfect laptop solution.
System Design
Dataset
We have a dataset laptop.csv where each row describes the features of a single laptop and also has a small description at the end. The chatbot that we build will leverage LLMs to parse this Description column and provide recommendations

Workings of the Chatbot
Note1 - Don't run this when you go through this section for the first time. Run this only after running through the rest of the code. When going through this for the first time, please only go through the output, to understand the workings of the chatbot

Note2 - The conversation shown here might be different from what you see in the video. However, the overall structure of the conversation to understand the system design remains the same.

dialogue_mgmt_system()
Assistant: "Hello! I am an intelligent laptop gadget expert. I can help you find the best laptop based on your requirements. Please let me know what you will be using the laptop for and any specific needs or preferences you have."

I am Kaustubh and I work as a management consultant.

Great! As a management consultant, you likely require a laptop that can handle multitasking and data analysis tasks efficiently. May I know what kind of software or tools do you primarily use for your work? Understanding the specific software will help me tailor my recommendations accordingly. Let me know if my understanding is correct until now.



No

I primarily work on Excel and powerpoint

Thank you for providing that information. Working with Excel and PowerPoint involves handling large datasets and creating presentations, which requires good processing speed and multitasking capability. Do you often work with complex formulas and macros in Excel? Understanding the complexity of your tasks will help determine the processing power needed.



No

Yes, I have created Macros in both Excel and Powerpoint

Thank you for the information. Creating macros in Excel and PowerPoint indicates that you require a laptop with good processing speed and multitasking capability. To ensure I have a complete understanding of your needs, I have one more question: Are you frequently on the go and require a laptop that is lightweight and easy to carry, or do you primarily work from a stationary location?



No

Yes, I carry my laptop as i need to travel to client locations.

Thank you for letting me know. Since you travel frequently, it would be beneficial to have a laptop that is lightweight and portable. This will make it easier for you to carry it around. Could you kindly let me know your budget for the laptop? This will help me find options that fit within your price range while meeting the specified requirements.



No

60,000 INR

Thank you for providing your budget. Based on your requirements and budget, I have updated the values in the dictionary as follows:

{'GPU intensity': 'medium', 'Display quality': 'medium', 'Portability': 'high', 'Multitasking': 'high', 'Processing speed': 'high', 'Budget': 60000}

Please note that the values for 'GPU intensity', 'Display quality', 'Portability', 'Multitasking', and 'Processing speed' are subjective and based on your stated requirements. However, the budget value is directly extracted from your response.

Is there anything else I can assist you with?



Yes



Output: {'GPU intensity': 'medium', 'Display quality': 'medium', 'Portability': 'high', 'Multitasking': 'high', 'Processing speed': 'high', 'Budget': '60000'}

Thank you for providing all the information. Kindly wait, while I fetch the products:

1. Lenovo ThinkPad: Ryzen 7 processor, 16GB RAM, SSD storage, 14" IPS display, NVIDIA GTX graphics, Linux OS, 1.6 kg weight, backlit keyboard, 3-year warranty, 6 hours battery life. Price: Rs 60,000.

2. MSI GL65: Intel Core i7 processor, 16GB RAM, HDD+SSD storage, 15.6" IPS display, NVIDIA GTX graphics, Windows 10 OS, 2.3 kg weight, RGB keyboard, 2-year warranty, 4 hours battery life. Price: Rs 55,000.

I apologize if I couldn't assist you. If you have any questions in the future, feel free to ask. Have a great day!

As you could see in the output above, the chatbot should ask a series of questions to

Determine the user's requirments. For simplicity, we have used 6 features to encapsulate the user's needs. The 6 features are as follows:

GPU intensity
Display quality
Portability
Multitasking
Processing speed
Budget
Confirm if the user's requirements have been correctly captured at the end.

After that the chatbot lists down the top 3 products that are the most relevant, and engages in further conversation to help the user find the best one.

Building the Chatbot
Chatbot_sys_design.png

As shown in the image, the chatbot contains the following layers:

Intent Clarity Layer
Intent Confirmation Layer
Product Mapping Layer
Product Information Extraction Layer
Product Recommendation Layer
Major functions behind the Chatbot
Let's now look at a brief overview of the major functions that form the chatbot. We'll take a deep dive later

initialize_conversation(): This initializes the variable conversation with the system message.
get_chat_model_completions(): This takes the ongoing conversation as the input and returns the response by the assistant
moderation_check(): This checks if the user's or the assistant's message is inappropriate. If any of these is inappropriate, it ends the conversation.
intent_confirmation_layer(): This function takes the assistant's response and evaluates if the chatbot has captured the user's profile clearly. Specifically, this checks if the following properties for the user has been captured or not GPU intensity, Display quality, Portability, Multitasking, Processing speed, Budget
dictionary_present(): This function checks if the final understanding of user's profile is returned by the chatbot as a python dictionary or not. If there is a dictionary, it extracts the information as a Python dictionary.
compare_laptops_with_user(): This function compares the user's profile with the different laptops and come back with the top 3 recommendations.
initialize_conv_reco(): Initializes the recommendations conversation
Implementation
Import the libraries
Let's start by importing the libraries that we'll require for this project. Following are the ones:

openai
pandas
os, json, ast
The api key is in a text file api_key.txt.

# !pip install openai
import os,json,ast
import openai
import pandas as pd
# read the API key
openai.api_key = open("api_key.txt", "r").read().strip()
Implementing Intent Clarity and Intent Confirmation Layers
Let's start with the first part of the implementation - building the intent clarity and intent confirmation layers. As mentioned earlier, this layer helps in identifying the user requirements and passing it on to the product matching layer. Here are the functions that we would be using for building these layers:

initialize_conversation(): This initializes the variable conversation with the system message. Using prompt engineering and chain of thought reasoning, the function will enable the chatbot to keep asking questions until the user requirements have been captured in a dictionary. It also includes Few Shot Prompting(sample conversation between the user and assistant) to align the model about user and assistant responses at each step.
def initialize_conversation():
    '''
    Returns a list [{"role": "system", "content": system_message}]

    delimiter = "####"
    example_user_req = {'GPU intensity': 'high','Display quality': 'high','Portability': 'low','Multitasking': 'high','Processing speed': 'high','Budget': '150000'}

    system_message = f"""

    You are an intelligent laptop gadget expert and your goal is to find the best laptop for a user.
    You need to ask relevant questions and understand the user profile by analysing the user's responses.
    You final objective is to fill the values for the different keys ('GPU intensity','Display quality','Portability','Multitasking','Processing speed','Budget') in the python dictionary and be confident of the values.
    These key value pairs define the user's profile.
    The python dictionary looks like this {{'GPU intensity': 'values','Display quality': 'values','Portability': 'values','Multitasking': 'values','Processing speed': 'values','Budget': 'values'}}
    The values for all keys, except 'budget', should be 'low', 'medium', or 'high' based on the importance of the corresponding keys, as stated by user.
    The value for 'budget' should be a numerical value extracted from the user's response.
    The values currently in the dictionary are only representative values.

    {delimiter}Here are some instructions around the values for the different keys. If you do not follow this, you'll be heavily penalised.
    - The values for all keys, except 'Budget', should strictly be either 'low', 'medium', or 'high' based on the importance of the corresponding keys, as stated by user.
    - The value for 'budget' should be a numerical value extracted from the user's response.
    - 'Budget' value needs to be greater than or equal to 25000 INR. If the user says less than that, please mention that there are no laptops in that range.
    - Do not randomly assign values to any of the keys. The values need to be inferred from the user's response.
    {delimiter}

    To fill the dictionary, you need to have the following chain of thoughts:
    {delimiter} Thought 1: Ask a question to understand the user's profile and requirements. \n
    If their primary use for the laptop is unclear. Ask another question to comprehend their needs.
    You are trying to fill the values of all the keys ('GPU intensity','Display quality','Portability','Multitasking','Processing speed','Budget') in the python dictionary by understanding the user requirements.
    Identify the keys for which you can fill the values confidently using the understanding. \n
    Remember the instructions around the values for the different keys.
    Answer "Yes" or "No" to indicate if you understand the requirements and have updated the values for the relevant keys. \n
    If yes, proceed to the next step. Otherwise, rephrase the question to capture their profile. \n{delimiter}

    {delimiter}Thought 2: Now, you are trying to fill the values for the rest of the keys which you couldn't in the previous step.
    Remember the instructions around the values for the different keys. Ask questions you might have for all the keys to strengthen your understanding of the user's profile.
    Answer "Yes" or "No" to indicate if you understood all the values for the keys and are confident about the same.
    If yes, move to the next Thought. If no, ask question on the keys whose values you are unsure of. \n
    It is a good practice to ask question with a sound logic as opposed to directly citing the key you want to understand value for.{delimiter}

    {delimiter}Thought 3: Check if you have correctly updated the values for the different keys in the python dictionary.
    If you are not confident about any of the values, ask clarifying questions. {delimiter}

    Follow the above chain of thoughts and only output the final updated python dictionary. \n


    {delimiter} Here is a sample conversation between the user and assistant:
    User: "Hi, I am an editor."
    Assistant: "Great! As an editor, you likely require a laptop that can handle demanding tasks. Hence, the laptop should have high multitasking capability. You would also need a high end display for better visuals and editing. May I know what kind of work do you primarily focus on? Are you more involved in video editing, photo editing, or both? Understanding the specific type of editing work will help me tailor my recommendations accordingly. Let me know if my understanding is correct until now."
    User: "I primarily work with After Effects."
    Assistant: "Thank you for providing that information. Working with After Effects involves working with graphics, animations, and rendering, which will require high GPU. Do you work with high-resolution media files, such as 4K videos or RAW photos? Understanding your file sizes will help determine the storage capacity and processing power needed."
    User: "Yes, sometimes I work with 4K videos as well."
    Assistant: "Thank you for the information. Processing 4K vidoes will require a good processor and high GPU. I think we have already determined earlier that you need a high GPU. To ensure I have a complete understanding of your needs, I have one more question: Are you frequently on the go and require a laptop that is lightweight and easy to carry, or do you primarily work from a stationary location?"
    User: "Yes, sometimes I travel but do not carry my laptop."
    Assistant:"Could you kindly let me know your budget for the laptop? This will help me find options that fit within your price range while meeting the specified requirements."
    User: "my max budget is 1.5lakh inr"
    Assistant: "{example_user_req}"

Let's now look at the next function.

get_chat_model_completions(): This takes the ongoing conversation as the input and returns the response by the assistant
# recall that messages is a list of dicts
# [{"role": "system", "content": system_message},
# {"role": "user", "content": user_input},
# {"role": "assistant", "content": assistant_message}]

def get_chat_model_completions(messages):
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages=messages,
        temperature=0, # this is the degree of randomness of the model's output
        max_tokens = 3000
    )
    return response.choices[0].message["content"]

Let's pass the initialized conversation debug_conversation and see what is the assistant's response.

debug_introduction = get_chat_model_completions(debug_conversation)
print(debug_introduction)
Hello! I am an intelligent laptop gadget expert and I am here to help you find the best laptop for your needs. Please let me know what you will be using the laptop for and any specific requirements you have.
Let's play around a bit and add the following user's input debug_user_input to the conversation debug_conversation and see what the assistant responds with.

debug_user_input = "Hi, I am Anand. I need a laptop for coding."
debug_conversation.append({"role": "user", "content": debug_user_input})
debug_response_assistant = get_chat_model_completions(debug_conversation)
print(debug_response_assistant)
Great! As a coder, you likely require a laptop that can handle multitasking and has a good processing speed. May I know what kind of coding work do you primarily focus on? Are you more involved in web development, data analysis, or software development? Understanding the specific type of coding work will help me tailor my recommendations accordingly. Let me know if my understanding is correct until now.
Typically, whenever the chatbot is interacting with the user, all the conversations should be moderated to identify any inappropriate content. Let's look at the function that can help with it.

moderation_check(): This checks if the user's or the assistant's message is inappropriate. If any of these is inappropriate, you can add a break statement to end the conversation.
def moderation_check(user_input):
    response = openai.Moderation.create(input=user_input)
    moderation_output = response["results"][0]
    if moderation_output["flagged"] == True:
        return "Flagged"
    else:
        return "Not Flagged"
Let's test moderation on the debug_user_input

debug_moderation = moderation_check(debug_user_input)
print(debug_moderation)
Not Flagged
Let's now test moderation on some other text.

print(moderation_check("I want to kill Ravan."))
print(moderation_check("I need a laptop to hack NASA."))
Flagged
Not Flagged
So, this moderation api may not be perfect but if you ask this to the ChatGPT or it's API (GPT 3.5), it'll not help you with such requests. Remember, moderation should also be applied on the GPT 3.5's output.

Let's now check moderation on the assistant's response debug_response_assistant.

moderation_check(debug_response_assistant)
'Not Flagged'
As mentioned earlier, you need to understand the user's profile, which essentially means that all the features: GPU intensity, Display quality, Portability, Multitasking, Processing speed, Budget are captured or not. Let's look at the function that helps us verify that.

intent_confirmation_layer(): This function takes the assistant's response and evaluates if the chatbot has captured the user's profile clearly. Specifically, this checks if the following properties for the user has been captured or not
GPU intensity
Display quality
Portability
Multitasking
Processing speed
Budget

Let's now look at the working of dictionary_present().

dictionary_present(): This function checks if the final understanding of user's profile is returned by the chatbot is a Python dictionary or not. This is important as it'll be used later on for finding the right laptops using dictionary matching.

So, now that you have the user profile stored in response_dict_n. We'll use this to generate recommendations. Before that, we need to create a similar profile for every laptop. Let's see how we do it.

Implementing the Product Mapping and Information Extraction Layers
In this section, we take in the output of the previous layers, i.e. the user requirements, which is in the format of a Python dictionary, and extract the top 3 laptop recommendations based on that. Here are the functions that we will use to help us implement the information extraction and product matching layers

product_map_layer(): This function is responsible for extracting key features and criteria from laptop descriptions. Here's a breakdown of how it works:
Uses a prompt that assign it the role of a Laptop Specifications Classifier, whose objective is to extract key features and classify them based on laptop descriptions.
Provide step-by-step instructions for extracting laptop features from description.
Assign specific rules for each feature (e.g., GPU Intensity, Display Quality, Portability, Multitasking, Processing Speed) and associate them with the appropriate classification value (Low, Medium, or High).
Includes Few Shot Prompting(sample conversation between the user and assistant) to demonstrate the expected result of the feature extraction and classification process.
def product_map_layer(laptop_description):

  delimiter = "#####"
  lap_spec = {
      "GPU intensity":"(Type of the Graphics Processor)",
      "Display quality":"(Display Type, Screen Resolution, Display Size)",
      "Portability":"(Laptop Weight)",

  You are a Laptop Specifications Classifier whose job is to extract the key features of laptops as per their requirements.
  To analyze each laptop, perform the following steps:
  Step 1: Extract the laptop's primary features from the description {laptop_description}
  Step 2: Store the extracted features in {lap_spec} \
  Step 3: Classify each of the items in {lap_spec}into {values} based on the following rules: \
  {delimiter}
  GPU Intensity: low: < for Integrated graphics or entry-level dedicated graphics like Intel UHD > , \n
  medium: < if Mid-range dedicated graphics like M1, AMD Radeon, Intel Iris > , \n

  Display Quality: low: < if resolution below Full HD (e.g., 1366x768). > , \n
  medium: < if Full HD resolution (1920x1080) or higher. > , \n
  high: < if High-resolution display (e.g., 4K, Retina) with excellent color accuracy and features like HDR support. > \n

  Portability: low: < if laptop weight is less than 1.51 kg > , \n
  medium: < if laptop weight is between 1.51 kg and 2.51 kg> , \n

debug_recommendation = get_chat_model_completions(debug_conversation_reco)
print(debug_recommendation + '\n')
1. Acer Predator: Intel Core i7 processor, 16GB RAM, SSD storage, 17.3" IPS display, NVIDIA GTX graphics card, dual cooling fans, 1-year warranty, 5-hour battery life. Price: Rs 80,000.

2. Lenovo ThinkPad: AMD Ryzen 7 processor, 16GB RAM, SSD storage, 14" IPS display, NVIDIA GTX graphics card, backlit keyboard, 3-year warranty, 6-hour battery life. Price: Rs 60,000.

3. MSI GL65: Intel Core i7 processor, 16GB RAM, HDD+SSD storage, 15.6" IPS display, NVIDIA GTX graphics card, RGB keyboard, 2-year warranty, 4-hour battery life. Price: Rs 55,000.

Now, you can converse with the chatbot on the filtered products.

Future Scope of Work
The output format of each layer is inconsistent. You can use the function API capability of GPT to instruct the output format as per the input request.
The rule framework provided to classify each laptop’s specification is not exhaustive. You can expand the rules to give a comprehensive context to the LLM.
There are misclassifications in the laptop’s specifications, even after specifying clear rules for LLM. You can fine-tune an open-source LLM to make its understanding & performance better.
Once the products are extracted, the dialogue flow doesn’t allow recalling of product extraction if there is any intent change. You can add another layer to observe any request for a change in the user intent and then use this flag to recall the product extraction based on the updated intent.
As an alternative & simple solution, you can use vector embeddings of each product and compare it with the user intent to find the most relevant products.
You can template this workflow/solution to build a chatbot for any product domain. Note: You must add the relevant domain expertise/rules to give the LLM context understanding.
